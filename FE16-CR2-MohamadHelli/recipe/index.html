                Blue Lagona:
                </span><br> Nothing says summer like a mojito and this blue mojito recipe takes that summer feeling to a whole other level. If you love the taste of rum and lime, you will love this ocean blue drink that is sometimes called
                a Blue Curacao Mojito. Yes, blue curacao is what gives this drink its beautiful color – it makes you want to dive into a bright blue swimming pool after taking a sip. The great news is that this is an easy drink to make, like most mojitos.
                Plus, you can jazz it up with some variations if you want.

                Steak With Rosemary Sauce :
                </span><br> This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and
                so juicy inside. It really doesn’t get any easier than this and you don’t need much to make a lip-smacking good steak. We used 2 New York Strip Steaks (pictured below), each weighing 1 pound and 1 1/4″ thick. Keep in mind a thicker steak
                will take longer to cook through and a thinner steak will cook faster.
